Features:
*  Works nearly NWN2 Quick Cast but uses items instead.
*  Expandable item categories: click item header to show/hide the item type.
*  Scalable window, use top right button to click and drag to scale window to fit your screen.
*  Drag window, use top header where it says quick cast to move window.
*  Resize window, use bottom edge to resize window in Y direction.
*  Settings button in top right (gears) will allow the binding to hide and show window to be set. This will also allow back color to be set.
*  Search bar at the top filters items by names 

Planned Features:
*  White/Black lists
*  Filtering out invalid items

Known Issue:
*  If an item is used and leaves your inventory the list is refreshed causing the list to snap back to the top.  This is from QuickCast as the list never
 needed to be updated when visable to the player.  This will not be fixed.
